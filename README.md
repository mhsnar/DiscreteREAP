# MPC
Discrete-Time Implementation of Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control

# Implementation
To implement the Discrete Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control (DisREAP), follow these steps:

Extract the contents of the YALMIP zip file in the same directory.
Run the DisREAP_UI function.
Import your system and desired configurations.
Execute the package.
For guidance, there are two examples included:

The first example is implemented on the Parrot Bebop 2 drone.
The second example is implemented on a second-order dynamic system benchmark.
These examples will help you understand how to run the system and interpret the results.
