# Discrete Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control (DisREAP)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started:
1. **Extract the YALMIP zip file** to your desired location.
2. **Run the `DisREAP_UI` function** in MATLAB.

## üöÄ Usage:
1. **Import your system and desired configurations**:
   - After running `DisREAP_UI`, import your system model and specify your desired configurations.
2. **Execute the package** to start the control process.

## üìö Examples:
For guidance, the package includes two examples:
1. **Parrot Bebop 2 Drone**:
   - This example demonstrates the implementation of DisREAP on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.
2. **Second-Order Dynamic System Benchmark**:
   - This example showcases DisREAP applied to a second-order dynamic system.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Examples:
1. **Navigate to the examples directory**:
   - Open the folder containing the examples within the extracted files.
2. **Run the example scripts**:
   - Follow the instructions in the example scripts to see the results and understand how to set up and execute your own system.

ABSTRACT="This paper presents the first release of the Explicit Reference Governor Toolbox (ERGT). The ERGT aims at providing a user-friendly interface for the design of an ERG scheme. The ERGT includes several built-in functions for the design phase, as well as some Simulink blocks to help with the simulation. In this current stage, this toolbox is aimed towards the design of ERG control systems for linear systems subject to the union and intersection of linear constraints. The paper presents a simple example on an aerial robotic application."
