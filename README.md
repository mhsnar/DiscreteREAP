# Discrete Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control (DisREAP)

## 🛠️ Getting Started:
1. **Extract the YALMIP zip file** to your desired location.
2. **Run the `DisREAP_UI` function** in MATLAB.

## 🚀 Usage:
1. **Import your system and desired configurations**:
   - After running `DisREAP_UI`, import your system model and specify your desired configurations,  enable plots, and simulate the system to observe results.

## 📚 Examples:
For guidance, the package includes two examples:
1. **Parrot Bebop 2 Drone**:
   - This example demonstrates the implementation of DisREAP on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.
2. **Second-Order Dynamic System Benchmark**:
   - This example showcases DisREAP applied to a second-order dynamic system.

## ▶️ Running Examples:
1. **Navigate to the examples directory**:
   - Open the folder containing the examples within the extracted files.
2. **Run the example scripts**:
   - Follow the instructions in the example scripts to see the results and understand how to set up and execute your own system.
