# MPC
Discrete-Time Implementation of Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control

# Implementation
To implement the Discrete Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control (DisREAP), follow these steps:

1. Extract the contents of the YALMIP zip file in the same directory.
2. Run the DisREAP_UI function.
3. Import your system and desired configurations.
4. Execute the package.
For guidance, there are two examples included:

The first example is implemented on the Parrot Bebop 2 drone.
The second example is implemented on a second-order dynamic system benchmark.
These examples will help you understand how to run the system and interpret the results.


# Discrete Robust to Early Termination Model Predictive Control (DisREAP)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started:
1. **Extract the zip file** to your desired location.
2. **Run the `DisREAP_UI` function** in MATLAB.

## üöÄ Usage:
1. **Import your system and desired configurations**:
   - After running `DisREAP_UI`, import your system model and specify your desired configurations.
2. **Execute the package** to start the control process.

## üìö Examples:
For guidance, the package includes two examples:
1. **Parrot Bebop 2 Drone**:
   - This example demonstrates the implementation of DisREAP on a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.
2. **Second-Order Dynamic System Benchmark**:
   - This example showcases DisREAP applied to a second-order dynamic system.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Examples:
1. **Navigate to the examples directory**:
   - Open the folder containing the examples within the extracted files.
2. **Run the example scripts**:
   - Follow the instructions in the example scripts to see the results and understand how to set up and execute your own system.
